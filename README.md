# Biography

![Baby Dorothy](/images/dorothybaby.jpg){:.topimage}

I grew up undiagnosed autistic/ADHD in a series of small towns, spending most of my childhood in a tree with a book. While writing and voracious reading have always been my passion, I’ve been a dancer in a dance company, started my own performance art company with a friend in the 90s, and am now in a community classical guitar orchestra. I’ve been a teacher of the blind, a bookseller, and a school librarian. But always writing, always reading.
