# Biography

![Baby Dorothy](/images/dorothybaby.jpg){:.topimage}

I grew up in a series of small towns, spending most of my childhood in a tree with a book.
After studying philosophy and dance at the College of Wooster in Ohio, I danced in a dance company and had my own performance art company with a friend. Tired of being poor, I studied for my M.Ed. in vision impairment and taught blind and low vision kids for three years. The desire to create became too much, and I started writing short stories while working as a children’s bookseller. Vermont College announced that it was starting an MFA in Writing for Children and Young Adults program, and I was delighted and got my second master’s degree. I was lucky enough to spend some time after that writing full time until I could no longer afford to do that. I received my third master’s degree from Kent State in School Librarianship and went to work as a school librarian for six years. When I found that I could afford to do so, I quit to write full time, again. I’m a late-diagnosed autistic person with ADHD and Bipolar Disease, which I have found gives me an interesting perspective
