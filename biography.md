I grew up in a series of small towns, spending most of my childhood in a tree with a book.

After studying philosophy and dance at the College of Wooster in Ohio, I danced in a dance company 
and had my own performance art company with a friend. When I was tired of being poor, I studied for 
my M.Ed. in vision impairment and taught blind and low vision kids for three years.

The desire to create became too much, and I started taking art classes and  writing short stories 
working as a children’s bookseller. Vermont College announced that it was starting an MFA in writing 
for children and young adults program and I was delighted and got my second master’s degree. 
I spent some time after that writing full time until I could no longer afford to do that. 
I received my third master’s degree from Kent State in School Librarianship and went to work 
as a school librarian for six years. When I found that I could afford to do so, I quit to write full time, again.
